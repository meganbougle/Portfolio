Hi everyone! Welcome to my most important projectâ€”my portfolio. On this website I showcase all my experience and projects created through out my journey of an upcoming Information Systems Engineer.
In order to build this site, I decided to use HTML, Tailwind CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript.

/Version Updates
Version 1.0 (April 2024)-Initially began with a Mac Desktop inspired design, all sections were seperate pages (not on the primary page), rusty code and design was up for improvement.
Version 2.1- Eliminated the old folder navbar (originally inspired by Mac folders) and created a basic new one, added custom fonts, deleted old code and improved the existing structure on the main page using Tailwind grid template (was originally flexbox).

Public link coming soon, stay tuned!
